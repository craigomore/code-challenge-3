This is a web application for browsing and managing a collection of films. It fetches film data from a local db.json file and provides an interactive interface to:

View a list of films with titles and posters.
Select a film to see detailed information (description, runtime, showtime, ticket availability).
"Buy" tickets for a selected film (updates availability locally in the browser).
Delete films from the list (removes locally; does not persist to the server/file).
The app is built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScriptâ€”no frameworks or backend required. It's designed to be responsive and user-friendly, with a clean layout featuring a sidebar for the film list and a main area for details.
